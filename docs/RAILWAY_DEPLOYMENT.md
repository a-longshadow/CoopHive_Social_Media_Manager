## üîß Railway Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Database

2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add all the variables listed above
4. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Update Google OAuth for Production

   https://coophive-social-media-manager.up.railway.app/accounts/google/login/callback/
   ```

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. In Railway dashboard, click "Deploy"
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Check logs for any errors

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Application failed to respond"
**Cause**: Missing environment variables or database connection issues
**Solution**: 
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure PostgreSQL is connected

#### 2. Database Connection Errors
**Cause**: Missing `DATABASE_URL` or PostgreSQL not running
**Solution**:
- Add PostgreSQL service in Railway
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is automatically set
- Check database is running

#### 3. Static Files Not Loading
**Cause**: Missing static file collection
**Solution**:
- Ensure `whitenoise` is in requirements.txt
- Static files are collected automatically during deployment

#### 4. Google OAuth Not Working
**Cause**: Wrong redirect URI or missing credentials
**Solution**:
- Update Google OAuth redirect URI for production domain
- Verify `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are set

#### 5. Email Not Working
**Cause**: Missing email credentials
**Solution**:
- Set `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` in Railway
- Use Gmail app password, not regular password

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Railway Logs
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and check logs
railway login
railway link
railway logs
```

### Test Database Connection
```bash
# Connect to Railway database
railway connect
```

### Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check all environment variables
railway variables
```
