### üõ†Ô∏è WHAT TO DO NOW

1. **DON'T PANIC** - Your files are protected
2. **Check what's missing** - Look at the error message above
3. **Restore missing files** - Use git to recover them:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- path/to/missing/file
   ```
4. **Verify integrity** - Run `python3 verify_project.py`
5. **Try again** - Once all files are present, commit will succeed
